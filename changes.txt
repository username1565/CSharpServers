Split HTTPServer.cs to 6 files:
	TcpServer.cs
	HttpRequest.cs
	HttpResonse.cs
	HTTPServer.cs
	TcpRequest.cs
	TcpResponse.cs

Rewrite Compile.bat to build all files, with /main:HttpServer.HttpServer, on windows
Rewrite Compile.sh to build all files, with /main:HttpServer.HttpServer on linux, with mono

___________________________________________________
Return files from www-folder

Add method Combine to combine bytes of headers, and bytes of file-content.
Set port 8080 as default.
Read port from args[0], if port is specified (first argument).
Listen port on IPAddress.Any (0.0.0.0)
Show IP and PORT, after start server
If not root address, and if file exists - read file, and return file content as html-text, or as binary data;
Do not show response in console.log, because binary content not displaying correctly.

Compile.bat: run compiled HTTPServer.exe with another port 8082

Now, any file from "www/"-folder, can be downloaded there: http://127.0.0.1:8082/filename.extension

Add "test.html" and "test.txt" in 
http://127.0.0.1:8082/test.html
http://127.0.0.1:8082/test.txt

Add GetBytes.html
http://127.0.0.1:8082/GetBytes.html (return bytes of test.txt, in console.log)

___________________________________________________
Add Compile.bat to compile this server on windows.
Add Compile.sh to compile this server on linux, with mono.
